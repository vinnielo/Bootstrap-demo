# Bootstrap-demo
created a bio/projects website using bootstrap. 
it consists of a nav bar that is on all the pages and is fully functional. 
on the index.html i have a carousel that houses my pictures. I added alt to all images. I included a small paragraph that is easily edit shoudl it need to be. I added comments that label all the components of the page. I also included links to my social media page that open in new windows once selected. 

Portfolio page contains navbar that is fully functional and images can be clicked and it will take the vistor to my projects and sites once they are ready to show. 

Contact page has the navbar and a contact form that is a mix from bootstrap and the CSS.

each html document. Has its own CSS that has functions to override certain bootstrap elements. One element had to be labeled as important (!important) in css. all other elements are in working order and deployed.
